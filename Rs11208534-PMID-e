The top hit out of 728 SNPs in 56 genes predicted to be involved in a cellular response to viral infection was rs11208534, for which the authors report T (major) and C (minor) alleles of rs11208534, not A and G as on dbSNP. Cases (n = 50) were recruited from patients with DHF-like symptoms by active hospital surveillance in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Controls (n = 236) who had experienced symptoms of DF, but not DHF, were recruited from families living within 1 kilometer of index cases, and were matched in age categories under and over 15 years. The association between rs11208534 and DHF (P-value 2.9x10-4; OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.1-12.7) just failed to reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 2.6x10-4 by itself, but when combined with two other highly linked SNPs in the JAK1 gene region, rs310196 and rs2780831 (D&#8217; 0.856 and 1.0 to rs11208534 respectively), the association reached significance with a P-value of 2.1x10-4.
