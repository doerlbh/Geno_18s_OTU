rs4804803	SARS	19	7747847	CD209,	gene info	PMID 15838506	. Both electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and promoter activity assays have revealed that the presence of the A allele results in higher rates of CD209 transcription and the production of more DC-SIGN gene product.

However, of those women with chronic HCV infection, presence of at least one G-allele at position 366 was associated with more advanced liver disease. Specifically, patients with the AG or GG genotype had significantly worse liver fibrosis scores (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and higher alanine aminotransferase (biomarker for hepatocellular injury) levels (p&lt;0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) than those with the AA genotype. This study tested only the <strong class="selflink">rs4804803</strong> SNP, so p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

rs4804803	SARS	19	7747847	CD209,	gene info	PMID 19264667	. The study tested four CD209 variants (336A/G, 332A/G, 201T/G and 139A/G; significance threshold approximately p&lt;0.0125); the protective effect of the <strong class="selflink">rs4804803</strong> G-allele for HTLV-1 infection (the reverse of what is observed for HCV) should therefore be considered weak. These authors also observed that the -336G allele occurred with higher frequency among Afro-Brazilians (42.0%) and Caucasians (26.7%) than in Asians (5.4%), and was not observed at all in the Amerindian group. 
rs4804803	SARS	19	7747847	CD209,	gene info	PMID 15838506	. This study investigated the effects of 40 separate CD209 polymorphisms on dengue susceptibility (significance threshold approximately p=0.00125), and <strong class="selflink">rs4804803</strong> was the only polymorphism that displayed a significant association. The carrier frequency of the G allele among individuals with dengue fever was 4.7%, compared to 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 19.5% in controls. This seems to indicate that the presence of the G allele at <strong class="selflink">rs4804803</strong> provides dominant protection against dengue fever (OR for protection = 4.90, p = 2e-6), but not against dengue hemorrhagic fever. Among individuals with dengue, genotypes GG and GA increased the risk of contracting dengue hemorrhagic fever instead of dengue fever (OR = 5.84, p = 1.4e-7).
rs4804803	SARS	19	7747847	CD209,	gene info	PMID 15838506	that the G allele was protective against dengue; however, the authors mentioned that the definitions of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever used in the two studies were different; in addition, the latter study was conducted in Taiwan while the former was conducted in Thailand, and the frequency of the G allele differed significantly between the two study populations (3.8% in populations of Chinese descent; 9.5-10.4% in Thailand).

rs4804803	SARS	19	7747847	CD209,	gene info	PMID 16379498	. Because the A allele was mainly confined to Eurasian populations, the authors speculated that this variant may have increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of host genetic adaptation to a longer history of exposure to tuberculosis.
